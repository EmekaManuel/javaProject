# Project Description

JAVA programming language is a multipurpose object oriented programming language which was used to create the following project.
The project at hand is a Simple Guessing Game using JAVA programming language. The project is built to generate a random number using the Random function, and compare it to entries taken from the user via the keyboard. If the user's guess is right, that is, if the comparison returns true, then the program tells the user that he or she got it right and the program ends. But if he or she doesn't get it right, even after 10 attempts, the game comes to an end and the user is told that he or she didn't get any of the guesses right.
Also included in the project is a functionality to guide the user's guess, by telling him or her if he guessed too high or low, so as to increase the chances of getting the correct number.
